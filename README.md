These are my dotfiles. There are many like them but these are mine.

Please take anything you'd like, but wholly at your own risk.

  * # here will be included when I've determined what is made auto-install

# The "dotfiles" command
--------------------------------------------------
Usage of the "dotfiles" command.

# Customize/extend
--------------------------------------------------
You can put your custom settings, such as Git credentials in the [system/.custom] file which will be sourced from [.bash_profile] automatically. This file is in [.gitignore].

Alternatively, you can have an additional, personal dotfiles repo at [~/.extra]. The runcom [.bash_profile] sources all [~/.extra/runcom/\*.sh] files.

# Additional resources
--------------------------------------------------
Here include helpful links, points of inspiration, and credits.
